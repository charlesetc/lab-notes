<p>Welcome! This is a place for me to publish less polished thoughts and
findings as they come up, research-related or otherwise. See <a href="#motivation">#motivation</a> for more details.</p>

<p>I’ve added an RSS feed for these notes! I’m using pandoc to render a
single markdown file into html, so had to figure out some way to get an
rss feed as well. I went with a ruby script to parse the markdown and
generate the xml on build. Turned out to be easier than I was
expecting!</p>
<p>See the feed here: <a href="./rss.xml">./rss.xml</a></p>

<p>Well I’ve been doing some long-form writing on my <a href="https://inclouds.space/blog">blog</a> and I’ve enjoyed it. But the
format necessitates a lot of editing and care, at least in my mind. This
can be good for me—practicing writing long form pieces and the editing
that goes with that—but it’s not easy and often either prevents me from
getting content out or seriously delays it. I’d like to be able to share
spure of the moment insights and snippets easily and quickly, in the
hopes that I end up getting a larger amount of content out and in
public. That too is good practice!</p>
<p>So please bear with me; thoughts might not be as fully-formed,
spelling might not be well-checked, grammer will be mid at best. This is
an experiment! I’m hoping the content itself can earn its keep despite
these potential pitfalls.</p>
<p>Also I like exclamation points and will probably use more of them
here than my normal blog! No more censorship!</p>

<p>As I add these lab notes to the nav of my main site, they are
replacing a link to my “forest” — an attempt at a digital garden I made
a few months ago. Recently it has become less of a garden and more of a
small, static grove of trees. So instead of pointing to it so directly,
I’m moving the link here. Please enjoy! <a href="https://forest.inclouds.space/">forest.inclouds.space</a></p>

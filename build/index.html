<h2 id="interaction-design-paper"><a href="#interaction-design-paper"
class="header-anchor">Interaction Design Paper</a></h2>
<p>I read a great paper today! <a
href="./static/how-bodies-matter.pdf">How Bodies Matter: Five Themes for
Interaction Design</a> It’s very much in line with the work we’ve been
doing at Folk, giving structure and words to the motivation for the
infusion of the physical world with computation and vice versa.</p>
<p>There’s a section therein that I wanted to speak to: “Risk”. The
authors make the very insightful point that real world interfaces often
have more risk associated with them: once you make a action there is no
way to un-make that action. Virtual interfaces on the other hand often
try to enable free history traversal. This risky commitment to action or
lack thereof can profoundly impact the attitude of the actor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Situations of higher risk cause people to feel more emotionally
negative and, therefore, more focused, paying closer attention to
detail, while situations of low risk allow people to feel more
emotionally positive, relaxed, curious, and creative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s valuable to think about what we give up when we move to a
risk-free way of interacting with the world. There are probably
circumstances where it’s valuable to build and use tools that embrace
this sort of focus-inducing risk.</p>
<p><em>However</em> I try to encourage and embrace emotionally positive,
curious, and creative mindsets with the tools that I build. This is one
of the reasons I love technology: it has the potential to induce these
mindsets. Reading this paper, you might think that moving more to the
physical world might necessitate taking on more risk in your actions and
therefore encounter less coziness in more physically-centered tools. But
I have found the opposite to be true:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Folk system we’re building actually has <em>more</em>
undo-ability and state agnosticism than traditional digital tools, not
less. The vast majority of the computation going on is a pure function
of the physical state of the system you’re working with. So while
traditional user interfaces might not always make clear <em>how</em> to
undo or the path of actions back-track along, in Folk it’s just a matter
of where you put items on the table. This actually amplifies the sense
of safety that digital tools are capable of creating, even while
bringing in more embodied interaction.</li>
<li>and working with physical objects in the real world—particularly
those which are well-designed and textured—can be a very cozy
experience. Especially compared to the traditional harsh physicality of
a computer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="writing-idea"><a href="#writing-idea"
class="header-anchor">Writing idea</a></h2>
<p>I had an idea for a blog post recently. Instead of trying to
formalize an argument for these sorts of physical computing interfaces
I’ve been exploring, I could write a post arguing <em>against</em> this
kind of theory. That is, trying to outline a generally good-faith
position that humans are very good at symbolic processing and thus
traditional coding interfaces are superior, that the keyboard and
multi-button mouse paradigm is a highly efficient interface far
surpassing anything that can be done on a tabletop, etc.</p>
<p>This would be an interesting position to try to elucidate— I’m sure I
would develop a more nuanced outlook in the process— but I am also
hoping that it would incite from the reader feirce critique against it
and in favor of physical computing. People love being contrarians
(myself included for sure) and this might just be the way to get them to
join the cause.</p>
<h2 id="book-binding"><a href="#book-binding"
class="header-anchor">Book-binding</a></h2>
<p>I’ve taken to printing out papers recently on physical paper. I’ve
been using newsprint - a somewhat silkier paper that actually seems to
hold up better under stress. I print out 2 pages per sheet,
double-sided, and then fold and staple them into pamphlets ready to be
grabbed on my way out the door. This makes for great subway reading!
Photo here:</p>
<p><img src="./static/paper.jpeg" /></p>
<p>I really can’t recommend this highly enough. It’s such a nicer
physical reading experience. It’s creatively satisfying to produce a
history of artifacts of my research. I even printed out a book this way
(from a pdf available online), saving $30 plus shipping charges. Letting
ourselves a moment of romance, we can glimpse into a society of
widespread indie book production! Basically printing is 3d printing for
books? Who’d’ve thought.</p>

<h1 id="2023-06-28"><a href="#2023-06-28"
class="header-anchor">2023-06-28</a></h1>
<p>Today was a nice day of calm focus and research.</p>
<p>I am trying to learn more about electronics. My last project involed
a raspberry pi zero and an oled display that got soldered on poorly, so
today I purchased a solder sucker and two microcontrollers. I have a lot
of ideas — suprisingly many are time-related? desk clock, watch,
physical timer, etc.</p>
<p>This sort of making is very motivating to me. I’m not sure if it’s
art or what, but the simple joy of practicing my own agency through
creation and learning in the process is just so wonderful. I’m not sure
where it’ll take me this time, but I’m leaning into it. Hopefully
somewhere interesting!</p>
<p>(In that vein, I found <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVGVsdEuPBs">this talk</a> by <a
href="https://twitter.com/hotemogf">Chia</a> to be very inspiring.)</p>
<p>I also applied to work as a teacher at a Brooklyn coding school
today. I’ve been reading a lot of education theory lately and am hoping
to see what it’s like to work with children directly. I’m guessing it’d
be super informative.</p>
<p>I also stumbled across what struck me as a lovely interactive piece
of art today. It’s a demo for accessing the webcam with rust in the
browser that just so happens to pixelate in a beautiful way. I had a lot
of fun dancing in front of the camera, enjoying an interactive control
of the light on the screen. Here’s an example of w is what it looks like
(having tea at the time):</p>
<p><img src="./static/pixel-tea.png" /></p>
<p>I enjoyed this so much that I hosted a static version for y’alls
enjoyment: <a
href="https://blocky.inclouds.space">blocky.inclouds.space</a></p>
<p>It’s just a static site right now but I’m imagining a social network
full of people sharing small blocky clips! There seems to be <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrackGenerator">a
web api</a> to create video in the brower but it’s not supported by
Firefox so I’m afraid that dream will have to wait. Though I might be
able to <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream_Recording_API/Recording_a_media_element">record
an html element</a> to create a vidoe?</p>
<p>Or maybe it could be fun to have a dedicated device (microcontroller
+ camera + display) in my house like this? Could be a nice artwork!</p>
<p>Anyways that’s all for today! 💻✨</p>
<p>P.S. I also came across <a
href="https://clementzheng.info/Teaching">Clement Zheng’s work</a> on
the Folk discord and it so very cool on so many axes.</p>

<h2 id="neovim-and-lua"><a href="#neovim-and-lua"
class="header-anchor">Neovim and Lua</a></h2>
<p>Well last weekend was very fun! I completely revamped my editor setup
- switching to neovim with only lua plugins. I’m extremely impressed by
the quality of this ecosystem. Especially compared to the vimscript
ecosystem, I’ve had far fewer bugs, plugins conflicting with each other,
latency issues, etc. Plus the plugins don’t seem to be bloated and the
start times are good! This has all happened just in the last couple of
years! Well done lua vimmers. Thank you.</p>
<p>I’m curious how my software-building desires will change now that I
have an editor I like. I’ve been leaning heavily towards the ‘build the
whole editor up from scratch’ route. I could see myself doing some more
neovim integrations instead in the future?</p>
<h2 id="folk"><a href="#folk" class="header-anchor">Folk</a></h2>
<p>I’ve been helping Andrés and Omar improve the folk system. We’ve made
a lot of progress even if it’s a bit slow! I’m optimistic. There’s a lot
of work that goes into real-time tracking. Most of the work has been on
camera-projector calibration and performance. The faster the system and
the better-calibrated is the more <em><strong>real</strong></em> it is.
The illusion holds. And more: the idea communicates. People can start to
understand the power of this kind of system. But yeah, it’s a lot of
systems programming and debugging.</p>
<h2 id="physical-interfaces"><a href="#physical-interfaces"
class="header-anchor">Physical interfaces</a></h2>
<p>There are some fun routes I’m exploring around physical interfaces to
computers:</p>
<h5 id="1-monocle"><a href="#1-monocle" class="header-anchor">1.
Monocle</a></h5>
<p>I just ordered a <a
href="https://brilliant.xyz/products/monocle">monocle</a>, a small AR
device that clips onto a camera frame. It’s essentially a tiny oled
display + a prism + a camera + two touch sensors + a bluetooth chip + an
FPGA + a battery + a clip. What a bundle!</p>
<p>Basically this lets you augment a very small rectangle in your
vision: drawing some graphics or writing some text. It seems like the
software is very much a work in progress. I’m not sure extent I’ll be
able to do with it, but I’m looking forward to finding out!</p>
<h5 id="2-magnetic-sheets"><a href="#2-magnetic-sheets"
class="header-anchor">2. Magnetic sheets</a></h5>
<p>I also bought some magnetic sheets from Amazon yesterday. They are
adhesive on one side so my plan is to print out some words on paper,
stick on the magnetic sheets, and then cut out the words. Much like the
refrigerator magnet poetry of my youth! But this time it’ll be Logo
commands with camera recognition. That’s right! Stay tuned.</p>
<h4 id="3-transparent-displays"><a href="#3-transparent-displays"
class="header-anchor">3. Transparent Displays</a></h4>
<p>The projector film arrived a couple days ago! I tested it out with
the folk system a bit, by placing a projector on the table pointing at
me and positioning a sheet of glass with the film between me and the
table. It’s pretty interesting!</p>
<p>Basically: it’s a transparent display! There are some air bubbles but
I would probably call that user error than anything else. Most of the
films are quite blurry at distances &gt; a few inches. One of them — the
most transparent — seems like it might be better in this regard.</p>
<p>What does this give you over just projecting onto a desk from above?
That’s the question I’m hoping to answer, I guess. I think the biggest
answer so far is that you don’t have to worry about the topology of what
you’re projecting on: the screen is flat and anything drawn to it will
appear un-distorted above the objects on the table.</p>
<p>I’ll get some photos and videos of it up on this page sometime
soon.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="2023-06-16"><a href="#2023-06-16"
class="header-anchor">2023-06-16</a></h1>
<p>Update time!</p>
<h2 id="folk-1"><a href="#folk-1" class="header-anchor">Folk</a></h2>
<p>I’ve had a performance regression on my folk system, with the frame
rate dropping to something like 10. It’s preventing me from
experimenting with higher level applications, since the kind of
interaction that I was showing in my last post is just terrible at
10fps. In the process of debugging!</p>
<p>I’ve also been helping out to improve the calibration in Folk. One
problem that you get in projector-camera mapping systems like this is
you often want to project a graphic relative to something that the
camera sees. But you don’t know a priori where the projector can project
in terms of the camera. Hence, projector-camera calibration: the process
of mapping camera coordinates to projector coordinates.</p>
<p>The way this works in Folk is it lights up each pixel of the
projector uniquely, paying close attention with the camera. But some
pixels from the projector don’t get seen by the camera, so it picks just
4 points that are and then comes up with a linear map using those 4
points between the projector space and the camera space. Unfortunately
this linear map doesn’t work so well because the distortion within the
camera and projector isn’t linear: there is radial distortion in their
lenses that aren’t taken into account. So we’ve been working on coming
up with a mapping that does take into account radial disortion. And even
more fun we’re working on mapping into 3d coordinates as well. Since we
know the physical size the April tags, we can infer how high up they are
in space. More accurate and 3-dimensional calibration will let folk
precisily project onto various portions of a page, even when it’s being
held and moved around in space. Very exciting!</p>
<p>I did write one higher-level primitive in folk: an “operator” card.
Basically, you can declare a card is an operator and then it’ll get
information about which cards are to the immediate left or right of it.
So you can have behaviour defined by putting three cards down in an
order. I’m planning on using this for doing a vector addition demo in
folk!</p>
<h2 id="societal-attention"><a href="#societal-attention"
class="header-anchor">Societal Attention</a></h2>
<p>Also and unrelated: I’ve been thinking about “societal attention”.
There’s this concept we have of individual, human attention. Something
gets brought up in an individual’s consciousness, and then they spend
time thinking about that thing. Those initial thoughts might lead to
more thoughts and, well, this is the process of paying attenion and
thinking about something.</p>
<p>So I think there is an analogous phenomenon in human societes:
something happens and whole groups of people end up thinking about it.
They think some thoughts, share them around, prompting more thoughts. My
insight here is that societies can kind of get “lost in thought” the
same way humans can: they can spend their time thinking and talking
about something, even if it doesn’t end up being useful or even if the
original bits of information that sparked the discussion were incorrect
or mistaken.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s worthwhile thinking about how we could short-circuit these
kinds of conversations once it’s clear (to whom?) that they are no
longer productive? Maybe it just takes a lot of individuals carefully
doing that in their own thinking processes?</p>
<h2 id="transparent-display"><a href="#transparent-display"
class="header-anchor">Transparent Display</a></h2>
<p>I got the projector films in the mail! I put them onto some glass and
put the glass in front of a projector, basically making a transparent
display. Pretty decent? It’s a bit unclear what the possible
applications would be. I’ll try to talk more about it in the future and
share some links/photos in case anyone else wants to try.</p>

<h1 id="2023-06-09"><a href="#2023-06-09"
class="header-anchor">2023-06-09</a></h1>
<p>I wrote my first meaningful folk program! Its goal is to prove <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales%27s_theorem">Thales’
theorem</a> by letting people interact with the pieces. Thale’s theorem
states that any triangle whose corners lie on the circumference of a
circle and whose hypotenuse is the diameter of the circle is a right
triangle. See for yourself:</p>

<p>Smoke and (AR) mirrors in New York City.</p>
<p>I’m happy to see a hype shift towards more HCI-related topics and
away from all AI all the time. AR relates more to my interests and,
while surely it has some distopian futures embedded in the discourse,
it’s at least not entirely centered around them.</p>
<p>A quick note on hype: I think people lose their minds when it comes
to new technology. New tech is cool and fun and often genuinely
transformative! But at any given time period those transformations are
finite. Some things change, some things don’t. And we are bad at knowing
what will and won’t change <code>n</code> months out. I try to be
careful of claims with absolute certainty. We all need some humility in
times like these.</p>
<p>Anyways!</p>
<p>Apple’s headset is cool — especially the eye tracking! We’ve never
seen it in mainstream tech hardware before. I’m really excited for the
possibilities. Though I don’t think I’ll rush to build an app for it.
I’m much more excited about projectors! The ability for tech to actually
<em>augment</em> the world without taking away my ability to engage with
the people therein. So important!</p>
<p>This brings me to <a href="https://folk.computer">Folk</a>. I’ve been
volunteering a little with the team, getting a home instance set up, and
it’s finally working!</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s much faster than I was expecting. Very satisfying to play with.
I think I’m getting around 30 frames per second. I don’t think 60 is
that far away and that’s even more exciting.</li>
<li>I’ve been experimenting with different paper types and sizes. I was
very pleasantly surprised by newsprint! Mine has a great kind of
soft-glossy texture, stacks well since it’s so thin, and has more of an
e-ink color compared to normal bright white paper. Also, suprisingly
durable! I’ve been cutting it to approximately A6 size for now and I
like that much better than letter or half-letter: there’s room for more
cards to fit under the relatively small projection space on my
desk.</li>
<li>I’ve been thinking about what I would want to build with this sort
of interface. There’s the question of “are the papers cenceptualized as
<em>the thing</em> you are manipulating or are they handles to an
explicitely virtual object?”. Maybe the answer has to be: both depending
on the context, but favor <em>the thing</em> when possible.</li>
<li>I’m torn about the english-like regex pattern matching syntax, which
is used to read and write from the Folk in-memory reactive database. On
the one hand, I do like the idea that things are extensible,
self-documenting, accessible, etc. But it is a bit verbose at times and
there is very little error information when you mistype something.
Better tooling might help!</li>
<li>It’s interesting that I already want <em>finer</em> inputs to the
things that I’m manipulating. I want to have a relative small circle
drawn and then be able to attach small things to it and so on. This is
not really easy to do given the size of April tags. There’s some thought
of switching to Bullseye feducials to get smaller feducial tracking, but
you’ll still have to worry about occluding tags with your hand.
Electrical engineering to the rescue?</li>
<li>It’s hard to know how much time to spend on the system itself or
learning how to build apps on top of it.</li>
</ol>
<p>I also spent a good amount of time researching in-air (transparent)
displays. Been thinking about how to create a folk-like experience by
positioning one between the table and my head, using cameras for
head-tracking.</p>
<p>There are two ways I was thinking of doing this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Find an LCD display, peel of the backing, and then hopefully get a
transparent LCD display panel.</li>
<li>Project onto a piece of glass with a film on it that is suspended
between you and a table with objects.</li>
</ol>
<p>Turns out that LCDs are quite dark even with the backing peeled off
and need a backlight to really shine, making projection still the way to
go.</p>
<p>So I got some samples of the film shipped to me, bought a glass
panel, some brass rods, and another ikea task lamp! Maybe this will turn
into something cool!</p>

<p>Some highlights from the past few days:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Continued work on the folk setup. Calibration between the camera and
projector isn’t working, still have to investigate that today. But I got
a wifi adapter so no hotspotting for me anymore!</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1665126377144590341">HTML
energy</a> event on saturday. Really fun to see people congregate to
make digital art!</li>
<li>I’ve been getting really into lua and hammerspoon recently. Made a
keybinding to let me quickly open these lab notes, for instance! It’s
fun to think of my computer as a display mechanism underneath a pile of
lua.</li>
<li>In the course of this lua splurge, I wanted to execute a program in
a directory <em>without</em> using a shell to <code>cd</code> there
first. It feels like this should be a built-in utility! Like how you can
set an environment variable with <code>env THIS=THAT</code>. So I made
it! It lets you
<code>exec-in a-directory    your-executable your-arguments</code>.
Worked great! Maybe there’s something else that does it? It was kind of
fun to write — I wrote the bash first and then asked an LLM to convert
it to C for me. <a
href="https://github.com/charlesetc/utils/tree/main/exec-in">github</a></li>
<li>I’ve been with <a href="https://just-be.dev/">Justin</a> about
making an in-air LCD display: completely transparent except when you
want it to show something. Like an iPad for AR I suppose? I’d be
interested in combining these with cameras to make a sort of window into
the augmented world.</li>
</ol>
<pre>---</pre>
<p>Update: Got calibration working and so the rectangles are now
following the april tags! The automatic calibration still isn’t quite
working, I had to manually feed in some of the points that it came up
with. And as you can see the calibration isn’t that good. But it’s a
starting point!</p>

<p>An awesome day. It started out by installing ubuntu on a small
desktop computer:</p>
<p><img src="./static/2023-05-31-01.jpeg" /></p>
<p>And then progressed to drilling holes into a vesa mount of a monitor
arm:</p>
<p><img src="./static/2023-05-31-03.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Which let me position a webcam and projector in the air:</p>

<p>To finally project a blue square on my desk:</p>
<p><img src="./static/2023-05-31-02.jpeg" /></p>
<p>And what a blue square it is!</p>
<p>There were too many issues to count along the way. The computer I got
ended up not having a wifi card built in but it did come with a usb wifi
adapter. I spent altogether too much time manually downloading the
debian packages needed to compile this adapter’s firmware only to find
out that it wasn’t compatible with the latest linux kernel version. So
I’m getting a new wifi adapter shipped, but in the meantime I went to
the store to buy an ethernet cable. This got me started but it wouldn’t
reach to the right desk, so I have ended up tethering my phone’s hotspot
through a usb connection. Which of course lead to more issues. My
printer is configured to work on my home network which this desktop
computer doesn’t have access to (since it doesn’t have a wifi card), so
printing out four April tags involved alternating between my phone’s
hotspot to get a single print job queued and then my home network to
actually print it. A wild ride for sure!</p>
<p>But it should all be worth it soon.</p>

<p>I’m in the process of setting up a <a
href="https://folk.computer">folk.computer</a> installation! Today
involved running to the hardware store to buy clamps, eyewear, power
strip, flash drive, etc. Tonight or tomorrow I’ll start drilling: have
to widen the holes in a monitor arm’s VESA mount to let through the 1/4”
20 screws that the projector and webcam use. I’m hoping that the end
result will be pretty clean!</p>
<p>Folk is a projector-camera “physical computing” interface and
operating system developed by <a href="https://cwervo.com/">Andrés</a>
and <a href="https://omar.website/">Omar</a>. The idea is you position a
camera and a projector above your desk and plug them into a computer
with access to a printer. This setup lets you:</p>
<ul>
<li>use computer vision to track April Tags (kind of like QR codes but
faster to recognize) in real time.</li>
<li>project light onto and around the objects you are tracking, informed
by information from the computer vision (position, rotation, skew of
tags in space).</li>
<li>print out sheets of paper with these April Tags, giving you the
ability to bring new augmented objects into the world with ease.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m extremely excited about this. Last week I witnessed a musical
performance where someone with no particular training manipulated 5
pieces of paper to create a musical experience. This is how we
seamlessly empower non-technical humans with technology: extraordinarily
easy, high-bandwidth interfaces you can <strong>play</strong> with.</p>
<p>Stay posted.</p>

<p>I added links on each header here! Had to use pandoc’s
gfm_auto_identifiers extension and then used a <a
href="https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html">lua filter</a> to add the
actual links to the header. This was an updated version of <a
href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-website/blob/master/tools/anchor-links.lua">the
filter</a> pandoc uses for its own documentation.</p>

<p>I’ve added an RSS feed for these notes! I’m using pandoc to render a
single markdown file into html, so had to figure out some way to get an
rss feed as well. I went with a ruby script to parse the markdown and
generate the xml on build. Turned out to be easier than I was
expecting!</p>
<p>See the feed here: <a href="./rss.xml">./rss.xml</a></p>

<p>Well I’ve been doing some long-form writing on my <a
href="https://inclouds.space/blog">blog</a> and I’ve enjoyed it. But the
format necessitates a lot of editing and care, at least in my mind. This
can be good for me—practicing writing long form pieces and the editing
that goes with that—but it’s not easy and often either prevents me from
getting content out or seriously delays it. I’d like to be able to share
spur of the moment insights and snippets easily and quickly, in the
hopes that I end up getting a larger amount of content out and in
public. That too is good practice!</p>
<p>So please bear with me; thoughts might not be as fully-formed,
spelling might not be well-checked, grammar will be okay at best. This
is an experiment! I’m hoping the content itself can earn its keep
despite these potential pitfalls.</p>
<p>Also I like exclamation points and will probably use more of them
here than my normal blog! No more censorship!</p>

<p>As I add these lab notes to the nav of my main site, they are
replacing a link to my “forest” — an attempt at a digital garden I made
a few months ago. Recently it has become less of a garden and more of a
small, static grove of trees. So instead of pointing to it so directly,
I’m moving the link here. Please enjoy! <a

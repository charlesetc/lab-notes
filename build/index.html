<p>Welcome to my lab notes! This is a place for me to publish less
polished thoughts and findings as they come up, research-related or
otherwise. See <a href="#motivation">#motivation</a> for more
details.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Well I’ve been doing some long-form writing on my <a href="https://inclouds.space/blog">blog</a> and I’ve been enjoying it.
But the format necessitates a lot of editing and care, at least in my
mind. This can be good for me—practicing writing long form pieces and
the editing that goes with that—but it’s not easy and often either
prevents me from getting content out or seriously delays it. I’d like to
be able to share spure of the moment insights and snippets easily and
quickly, in the hopes that I end up getting a larger amount of content
out and in public. That too is good practice!</p>
<p>So please bear with me; thoughts might not be as fully-formed,
spelling might not be as well-checked, ideas might not be
well-presented. This is an experiment! I’m hoping the content itself can
earn its keep despite these potential pitfalls.</p>
<p>Also I like exclamation points and will probably use more of them
here than my normal blog! No more censorship!</p>

<p>As I add these lab notes to the nav of my main site, they are
replacing a link to my “forest” — an attempt at a digital garden I made
a few months ago. Recently it has become less of a garden and more of a
small grove of trees. So instead of pointing to it so directly, I’m
moving the link here. Please enjoy! <a href="https://forest.inclouds.space/">forest.inclouds.space</a></p>

# Charles' lab notes

Welcome to my lab notes! This is a place for me to publish less polished thoughts and findings as they come up, research-related or otherwise. See [#motivation](#motivation) for more details.

## Motivation

Well I've been doing some long-form writing on my [blog](https://inclouds.space/blog) and I've been enjoying it. But the format necessitates a lot of editing and care, at least in my mind. This can be good for me—practicing writing long form pieces and the editing that goes with that—but it's not easy and often either prevents me from getting content out or seriously delays it. I'd like to be able to share spure of the moment insights and snippets easily and quickly, in the hopes that I end up getting a larger amount of content out and in public. That too is good practice!

So please bear with me; thoughts might not be as fully-formed, spelling might not be as well-checked, ideas might not be well-presented. This is an experiment! I'm hoping the content itself can earn its keep despite these potential pitfalls.

Also I like exclamation points and will probably use more of them here than my normal blog! No more censorship!


## Forest

As I add these lab notes to the nav of my main site, they are replacing a link to my "forest" — an attempt at a digital garden I made a few months ago. Recently it has become less of a garden and more of a small grove of trees. So instead of pointing to it so directly, I'm moving the link here. Please enjoy!
